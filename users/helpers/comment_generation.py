# ðŸ“„ Intelligent Feedback Generator â€” Student-Focused Psychological Commentary
#
# Description:
# This module generates subject-specific performance comments intended 
# exclusively for students. The comments are tone-aware, psychologically 
# calibrated, and motivational in nature. They are designed to:
#
# - Encourage self-reflection and personal growth
# - Deliver feedback in a supportive, empowering tone
# - Reduce performance anxiety by contextualizing peer comparison
#
# ðŸ”„ DIFFERENCE FROM TEACHER / PARENT COMMENTS:
# These comments are distinct from those shown to teachers or parents.
# While teacher and parent comments may emphasize diagnostic insight,
# comparative ranking, or academic intervention, these student comments
# prioritize emotional intelligence, intrinsic motivation, and resilience.
#
# The goal is to help students understand their performance while maintaining
# self-confidence and a growth mindset â€” not to evaluate or critique from
# an external perspective.
